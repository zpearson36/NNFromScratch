This is my attempt at creating a neural network from scratch

This attempt is intended to provide me with greater insight into how
neural networks function with the hope this insight will allow for
more flexible application of the concepts

I will be following along with the following youtube playlist:

UPDATE:

I will no longer be following the above tutorial as it is incomplete and does
not look to be completed in the near future.

As a result I will be changing tutorials to the Coding Train tutorial found here:
